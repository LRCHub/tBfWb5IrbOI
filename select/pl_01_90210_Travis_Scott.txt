Ooooooohhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh
[Verse 1]
She a porn star girl, oh, from the valley
Who left her home town world all for the alley
Oh, created Lake Tahoe all from her panties
Ooh, used to take the long way home,
long way home, all for that candy
[Verse 2]
Jacques to La Flame, now you rolling on the Addy
50 on the chain another 50 on the Cadi
Ohh
He might pop him a pill, pop him a seal,
Pop anyone, pop anything
Pop anything to find the alley
Hmm, yeah, to find the alley
Singing
[Chorus]
In that 90210, 90210, looking for the alley
In that 90210, 90210, looking for the alley
It's the superstar girl, superstar girl,
roamingin the alley
In that90210 90210, somewhere in the alley
[Verse 3]
Yo, my granny called
she said Travie you work too hard
I'm worried you'll forget about me
I'm falling in and out of cars
Don't worry I'ma get it granny
What happened now
My daddy happy
My momma called me up
The money coming in she let me at it
I done made it now
I done found my meaning now
All them days of heartbreak
Her heart out of pieces now
Friends turning into fraud niggas
Practicing, have the passion
You niggas packaged different
All you niggas
You niggas want the swag you can't have it
I'm a sell it
You niggas salary bout to cabbage
Youngest nigga out here Houston at the Grammys
Smiling at em laughing at me
I passed the rock to Ye,
he pump faked and passed it back, bitch
All of this offa rappin,
should've wrote this in Latin
[Verse 4]
Yeaaah
Hmmm, I know, I know, I know, I know, I know
I know, I know, I know, I know, I know
Cuzzo said we in the sto',
yeah, we bout to drop a 4
He passed the cigarette, I choked
Told my auntie put them ports down,
them ports down
Now you know you love your own now
Hit the stage, got they hands up
Don't put ya nose down
I aint knocking a nigga
I knock the door down, fa sho now
Hardcore, I swear they counting on me
Gold chains, gold rings, I got an island on me
Houses on me, he got them ouces on em
Holy father, come save these niggas
I'm stylin on em
Good lord I see my good fortune
in all these horses
I'm driving too fast to stop
So all the signs I ignore them
Just the sky from north of the border
Now my chicks is in order
My mind big as a boulder
So now niggas support a nigga
